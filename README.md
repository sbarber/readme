# Hello!
*Working with Scott? Here's what to expect!*

Caveat: I'm pretty aware of my faults - this document isn't my attempt at excusing them. This document also [isn't an attempt to build trust](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0). That happens as we work together.

Guiding Principals, Fun Trinkets, Things I Value
* Overcommunicate - [No going dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/). It's ok to say things more than once. Written communication helps solidify your thoughts (see: https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate #6 and #7).
* Pragmatist - What works for our team? People > Process. True [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)!
* Continuous improvement - Little by little let's make things better
* Process is good - When it's just enough to ease the pain and no more
* I don't want to die of boredom - Emojis and gifs are an awesome way to communicate. Please give cool names to projects.
* Data - Let's establish some OKRs and start collecting data. Trends! Cool graphs! How are we REALLY doing?
* [If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/)
