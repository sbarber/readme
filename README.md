# Hello!
*Working with Scott? Here's what to expect!*

Caveat: I'm pretty aware of my faults - this document isn't my attempt at excusing them. This document also [isn't an attempt to build trust](https://medium.com/@skamille/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0). That happens as we work together. This also isn't everything - this is just a start to get going.

## Who the :poop: are you?
* [Small-town](https://cityofpage.org/) raised, Millennial-leaning Gen-Xer who loves [music](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40tapH20guru%20mixtape&src=typed_query), cooking and technology.
* I'm pretty much [down the middle blue/green].(https://www.wearebowline.com/blog/8-personality-types-a-deeper-dive-into-insights-discovery/) (Supporting or Observing Coordinator)
* I'm [ISTJ](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISTJ)-ish.

## Guiding Principals, Fun Trinkets, Things I Value
* Overcommunicate - [No going dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/). It's ok to say things more than once. Written communication helps solidify your thoughts (see: https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate #6 and #7).
* Pragmatist - What works for our team? People > Process. True [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/)!
* Continuous improvement - Little by little let's make things better
* Process is good - When it's just enough to ease the pain and no more
* I don't want to die of boredom - Emojis and gifs are an awesome way to communicate. Please give cool names to projects.
* Data - Let's establish some OKRs and start collecting data. Trends! Cool graphs! How are we REALLY doing?
* [If it matters enough to be careful, it matters enough to build a system around it.](https://seths.blog/2018/11/quality-and-effort/)
* [Problem Prevention > Problem Solving](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1218724150312751104) - Planning and [Pre-Mortems](https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem) rock!
* Be Assertive - Not passive aggressive or plain old aggressive. Tact and open communication go a long way.

## My Job
* Attract and retain world-class talent (that's you)
* Set context and priority
* Remove blockers
* Advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company
* Be open to feedback
* Get to know you and learn how to communicate the best for you

## 1:1s
* We should talk regularly - once a week or once every other week.
* You set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you?
* These don’t need to be status updates unless you really want to talk about project status.
